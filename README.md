# Tau PET Harmonization on Cortical Surface

## Overview
Tau PET harmonization is essential to facilitate comparison and integration of tau Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data across multiple imaging sites, scanners, and protocols. Harmonizing PET data ensures consistency and reliability, especially when assessing tau pathology on the cortical surface for neurodegenerative research.

## Goals
- To standardize tau PET measurements across different imaging conditions.
- To enhance accuracy and comparability of tau PET data analysis on the cortical surface.
- To support multi-center studies and large-scale analyses involving cortical tau deposition.

## Methodology
The harmonization process typically involves:
- Preprocessing of raw PET data, including motion correction and alignment.
- Application of standardized cortical surface-based registration algorithms.
- Statistical and machine learning-based harmonization techniques (e.g., ComBat) to adjust for scanner-specific biases.
- Validation through cross-site comparisons and reliability assessments.

## Usage
1. **Data preparation:** Ensure PET data is preprocessed and co-registered to MRI-derived cortical surfaces.
2. **Harmonization pipeline:** Run the provided scripts or tools to harmonize PET signals across different scanners and sessions.
3. **Quality assessment:** Evaluate harmonization effectiveness using provided quality metrics or visual assessments.

## Applications
- Alzheimer's disease and other tau-related neurodegenerative conditions.
- Longitudinal studies examining progression of cortical tau pathology.
- Multi-site collaborations and consortium-based research.
